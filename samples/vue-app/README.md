# Vue.js Sample for MGT

This sample shows how to incorporate the Microsoft Graph Toolkit into a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app.

The sample was initially created with the [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) tool for Typescript and dart-sass.

## Setting up Vue for MGT

1. Install MGT with `npm install microsoft-graph-toolkit`
2. In your `App.vue` add `import 'microsoft-graph-toolkit';` to initialize the toolkit. **TODO: Bug #58**
3. Now you can use an MGT component in any of your Vue components!
