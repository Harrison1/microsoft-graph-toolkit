# The Graph Toolkit

...is a set of web components and helpers for accessing and working with the Microsoft Graph. The library is fully built in the open. 

## Get Started

Download the minified code from [here] and reference the toolkit.js in your html page. 

```html
<script src="./dist/es6/index.js"></script>
```

You can then start using the components in your html page

```html
<graph-login></graph-login>

<graph-persona persona-id="nikola metulev"></graph-persona>
```

All the components know how to talk to the graph as long as you provide an [authentication context](./authentication.md) they can use.


## NPM
Alternatively, you can install the components using npm

```bash
npm install microsoft-graph-toolkit
```

Then reference `node_modules/microsoft-graph-toolkit/dist/es6/index.js` in the page where you are planning to use it

```html
<script src="node_modules/microsoft-graph-toolkit/dist/es6/index.js"></script>
```
